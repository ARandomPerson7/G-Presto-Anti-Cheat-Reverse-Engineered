# Summary
This anti cheat is pretty small and there is a lot of java code in this anti cheat that I have not checked because of a really good obfuscation.
Overall the native part of this anti cheat was pretty easy to reverse engineer because the developers decided to not even hide symbols in their lib

# Bypass
I'm not providing bypass. Check out @spooderman's tutorial on polarmods
